I am a computational biologist with 10 years of extensive dry and wet research experience. Throughout my career, I have analyzed and integrated genomic and other biological information to understand processes driving genome regulation, disease, and phenotypic variation. I apply intensive exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and statistical approaches to address large-scale problems using genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. I rely heavily on my inherent resourcefulness to tackle new and challenging problems, while simultaneously highly-collaborative and capable of communicating extremely well with individuals from diverse areas of expertise.



# Services

#### Experimental Design
I can assist with the planning and design of small and large genomics projects, for nearly all genomic experiments, from bench to bioinformatics.

#### Data Generation
I can work within your research laboratory to perform specialized protocols in order to generate data for subsequent analysis (Boston area only):
- Genomic assay development
- RNA-seq (Illumina/Nanopore)
- Chromatin Structure (ATAC-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq)
- Genome Sequencing (Illumina/Nanopore)
- Bisulfite sequencing
- Targeted sequencing (Hybrid capture)
- Shotgun metagenomics/16s sequencing
- Chromatin conformation (Hi-C)

#### Data Analysis
I offer genomic data analysis services for a wide range of data types:
- Genome variation (SNP/indel/SV analysis, forward genetic screens, genome comparisons)
- RNA-seq (mRNA-seq, run-on sequencing, etc.)
- Chromatin Structure (ATAC-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq)
- De novo assembly and annotation (Illumina, Pacbio, Nanopore)
- DNA Methylation (bisulfite/EM-seq)
- Microbiome (metagenomics/16s)
- Chromatin conformation (Hi-C, 4C, 5C)
- Replication Timing (Repli-seq)
- CRISPR screens (GeCKO/CRISPRa/CRISPRi)
- RNA/Methyl/ChIP microarray analysis

#### Grant Proposals
I provide assistance with the design and preparation of proposals for private and public funding.
